In this paper, Alan Turing presents his proof for the assertion that some decision problems are undecidable: That there is no effective procedure that infallibly can give a correct yes/no answer to a well described problem. Lead to the idea of Turing Machine and resulted in Church-Turing Thesis (Showed that computational power of Turing machines is equivalent to that of ùúÜ-definable functions).
