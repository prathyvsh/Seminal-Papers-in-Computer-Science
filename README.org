In this paper, Alan Turing presents his proof for the assertion that some decision problems are undecidable: That there is no effective procedure that infallibly can give a correct yes/no answer to a well described problem. Lead to the idea of Turing Machine and resulted in Church-Turing Thesis (Showed that computational power of Turing machines is equivalent to that of ùúÜ-definable functions).

One of the papers that gave birth to denotational semantics (the method of analyzing programming constructs with the help of Lambda Calculus). The highly influential SECD machine was first introduced in this paper.
